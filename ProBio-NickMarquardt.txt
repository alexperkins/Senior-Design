# Project Sought

I am potentially interested in creating a musical robot with a Raspberry Pi that plays music through hitting pitched objects with sticks and mallets. Depending on how rigorous the assembly and programming of the robot is, it might also be cool to develop software to read and play MIDI files fed to the Pi right out of the box.
