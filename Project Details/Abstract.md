#### Abstract
This project is an exploratory study in the realm of cybersecurity. Honeypots are tools that are widely used to learn about, track, and prevent threats to a system. Attackers are baited with a phony system and from here they can be blocked, or just tracked. Our goal is to implement a honeypot that can do all these things, but also return malicious code that will allow us to gain access to and control the attackerâ€™s system.
