### Project Constraints

The biggest constraints on our project have to do with ethics, and security. Both of these aspects are tied closely together under the umbrella of cybersecurity. Some might question how ethical it is that we are trying to compromise another personâ€™s system in return for attacking ours. There are also security concerns with experienced hackers finding our honeypot. The constraint of ethics will be explored first.

Hacking can be used in an ethical way, and this project is ethical for the most part. The part that gets questionable is that the honeypot is returning the favor to the attacker. It could be argued that this honeypot is just reciprocating the malice of the attacker. Ultimately, the extent of the damage done to the attacker will be the deciding factor in that argument. Meddling with an attacker also raises security concerns.

Since the honeypot is being deployed, it will be especially visible to anyone looking to carry out nefarious acts. What happens if the attacker sees through the honeypot and is actually able to compromise the host? This, among other questions are still being addressed throughout the semester leading up to the full scale deployment of the malicious honeypot.
