#### Proj. background description:
This project is a study in the realm of cybersecurity. Honeypots are tools that are used
to learn about, track, and prevent threats to a system. Attackers are baited with a phony
system and from here they can be blocked, or just tracked. Our goal is to implement a
honeypot that can also return malicious code that will allow us to gain access to and
control the attackerâ€™s system.

#### Inadequacy of current solutions to problems: 
No current honeypots are used offensively. Mainly used for detection of malware/intruders or for research into the techniques used by intruders.

#### Background skills/interests relevant to problem:
###### Coding  
###### Security

#### Team approach (overall goals/expectations):
We will be doing extensive research on Honeypots and how they are implemented before coding. Beyond that, we need to set up an environment that is remotely reachable for all team members. Once these first two tasks are established, we will begin somewhat of a trial and error method of testing. We are hoping to learn about commands and scripts run that relate to cybersecurity, as well as how attackers penetrate systems.
