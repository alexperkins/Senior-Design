#### Proj. background description:
We are creating a honeypot that will take control over an attackers system via the information that is being exfiltrated by the attacker.

#### Inadequacy of current solutions to problems: 
No current honeypots are used offensively. Mainly used for detection of malware/intruders or for research into the techniques used by intruders.

#### Background skills/interests relevant to problem:
###### Coding  
###### Security

#### Team approach (overall goals/expectations):
We will be doing extensive research on Honeypots and how they are implemented before coding. Beyond that, we need to set up an environment that is remotely reachable for all team members. Once these first two tasks are established, we will begin somewhat of a trial and error method of testing. We are hoping to learn about commands and scripts run that relate to cybersecurity, as well as how attackers penetrate systems.
