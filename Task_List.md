<h3>Tasks</h3>
[]research honeypots: find out about what exactly a honeypot is, how its used, and how we can create one.

 	[]high, medium, or low level honeypot: determine which level of honeypot (in terms of interactivity) we will be developing.
	
 	[]Type of honeypot: determine what type of honeypot will be intuitive for us (malware, SSH, gaspot, SCADA).
	
[]select a language: figure out what programming language lends itself the best to creating a honeypot

[]select environment: determine how the honeypot will be run (PuTTY or Linux terminal… or both)

[]Logger: create a system for logging information for the terminal (no connection required yet)

[]Testing procedure: think of a safe way to test the honeypot in case actual attackers do pursue 

[]Set up server: create the server where the honeypot will be hosted and ensure everyone can connect

 	[]Create the environment: make up some users and files associated with users to attract attackers
	
[]Develop the honeypot: create a honeypot that can track a user’s activity and report relevant information

[]Enhance honeypot: develop any additional functions/features that come to mind along the way

[]Get malicious: create method of returning “sour” packets to the attacker

  []Spoof commands: create our own commands that seem like they are working, but are actually compromising attacker
