[]select environment(Nick): determine how the honeypot will be run (PuTTY or Linux terminal… or both)

[]Logger(Alex): create a system for logging information for the terminal (no connection required yet)

[]Testing procedure(John): think of a safe way to test the honeypot in case actual attackers do pursue
